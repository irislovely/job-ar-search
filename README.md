###Augmented Reality Job Search for TechLooper Contest

*This project's main purpose is to participate in VietnamWorks/TechLooper's contest.*

**TechLooper Website:** http://techlooper.com

**VietnamWorks Website:** http://www.vietnamworks.com

###Mockup Usage

This Mockup was created in HTML and can be viewed in both Desktop or Mobile:

•	**Desktop:** All Browser

•	**Mobile:** Mozilla Firefox

###Mockup Introduction

This UI/UX was created to connect all basic functions for the Vietnamworks Application. All users need their profile to use this app, so the User Profile is the first requirement of this app, but they can sign in with Facebook and Google+ and we still can get their data via API. Because this app was created for only one important goal, so we try to make it clean & easy to use.

####This Mockup could be started with this file: _project_vietnamworks.html_

**_This Mockup includes these screens:_**

•	**Login**

•	**Sign-in**

•	**Main Menu:** simple as we want, so users can see them all after 1-2 seconds

•	**Camera Search:** we use this word because it lacks of info and make users more curious. But it needs to be changed the UI to let them know about its function at the first time they see it

•	**Normal Search:** just like the website

•	**Search Results:** there’re 2 cases – YES or NO. But we changed the UI of the no result case. We also think that we will change the way that informations the search results show up.

•	**Job Details:** “Interested” data will be added to User Profile in the future

•	**Apply Jobs:**  “My CV” data will be added to User Profile in the future

•	**Email Me Jobs**

•	**User Profile:** It doesn’t have all the informations (based on APIs you gave us)



*Some screens & data that we didn’t create Mockup, because we wanna know how big the app will be or what it aims for and we also have limited access on API data:*

•	*Pre-load / Intro Screen*

•	*Sign-up Screen*

•	*CV and Job Interest Data*

•	*Company Pictures (of user) Data*

•	*Multi-results (Camera search):* this is the problem because with VNW search engine, you can search 1 company at the time. But in a real case, like Flemington Tower – there’re many companies inside the building, if someone don’t wanna go there and they just capture the building picture. As a result, we can’t detect all of them.
